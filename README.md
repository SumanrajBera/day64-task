# Task: Windows OS (DOM recreation)

A small front-end mini-project that recreates the look-and-feel of a simplified Windows desktop using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (DOM). This project focuses on UI/UX interactions rather than full OS functionality.

## What this project includes

- **Start menu** that toggles/open on click (works like the Windows Start button).
- **Right-click context menu** that opens a Windows-style context menu.
- **Clock & date** displayed in the taskbar — updates in real time.
- Responsive-ish layout that scales to desktop browser sizes.

## Features (current)

- Start menu pops up when you click the Start button.
- Right click on the desktop opens a Windows-like context menu 
- Time and date in the taskbar update every second.
